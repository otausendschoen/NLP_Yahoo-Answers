Obviouslz, if you consider distributions and when outcomes are Bernoulli, that is the least informative ditribution, you only know for example that class 2 is correct, but zou do not have anz information about the others. If you have soft targets (probability distribution) from the teacher, e.g., [0.01, 0.05, 0.70, 0.23, 0.01, ..., 0.00], then you learn that the teacher is mostly confident in class 2, but also thinks class 3 is plausible (e.g., it relates to computers),and class 1 is mildly relevant (math-related learning). The student now gets more nuanced supervision - not just \"what’s correct,\" but also \"how close are other classes?\" So what we get is a bigger or richer signal than we would get from the true label alone."

    "From this we can see that the combination of alpha = 0.2 and temperature = 1.0 yielded the best results in terms of overall performance. It achieved the lowest training loss (417.83) and the highest evaluation accuracy (66.70%), along with strong precision and recall values. This means that our student model benefitted most from a stronger emphasis on the teacher's predictions (1 - alpha = 0.8) and sharper (less softened) output distributions from the teacher (temperature = 1.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "When increasing the temperature to 2.0 or 5.0, we observe higher training loss and slightly lower accuracy across all alpha values. This suggests that over-smoothing the teacher's output distribution (via higher temperatures) made the learning signal less precise, especially for a student trained on only one epoch and a limited dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, increasing alpha, which shifts the loss more toward the ground truth labels, did not yield better performance. For example, with alpha = 0.8, the models performed consistently worse across all temperatures. This indicates that the teacher’s knowledge was more informative than the sparse ground truth in this few-shot setting, and leveraging that knowledge more (via a lower alpha) was beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this tells us that for fast, low-resource distillation, it's best to rely more on the teacher predictions (meaning low alpha), and also to keep the teacher outputs sharp (low temperature), and limit over-smoothing and underfitting by avoiding overly softened distributions or too much reliance on hard labels.\n",

The performance remains quite stable across different values of alpha and temperature, showing robustness of the distillation setup when using a well-initialized student.\n",

Even the largest variant tested (l4_d768 or l6_d768) fails to reach the baseline set by the pretrained student models. The worst performing variants (e.g., l6_d384, l8_d384) show that simply adding layers or reducing hidden size, without the benefit of pretrained weights, leads to unstable and ineffective training under distillation.\n",

    "From this we can see that training smaller student architectures from scratch, even when incorporating intermediate layer supervision—results in lower performance compared to models that leverage pretrained weights. In these experiments, all student models were initialized from the base DistilBERT checkpoint, while the classification layers were newly initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the total loss consistently decreased with higher learning rates. At a learning rate of 3e-5, the model reached a loss of approximately 591.44. Increasing the learning rate to 5e-5 reduced the loss to 577.48, and with 1e-4 it further decreased to 569.10. This pattern indicates that larger learning rates help the student model adapt more quickly, especially when layers like the classification head are randomly initialized and training is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when evaluating performance on the validation set, the relationship between learning rate and generalization was not monotonic. The model trained with the lowest learning rate, 3e-5, achieved the highest accuracy at 66.72%. In comparison, models trained with 5e-5 and 1e-4 achieved lower accuracies of 65.50% and 65.28%, respectively. This suggests that while larger learning rates improve training efficiency, they do not necessarily enhance generalization. In this setup, the more conservative learning rate of 3e-5 offered the best balance between fitting and generalizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the TinyBERT-style scratch-trained models, with reduced hidden sizes and fewer layers (e.g., 4 layers and 384 hidden dimensions), which struggled to exceed 49% accuracy, the intermediate distillation models (which preserve the full DistilBERT architecture and utilize both soft targets and hidden state alignment) performed significantly better, reaching over 66% accuracy. This highlights the clear advantage of combining pretrained knowledge with intermediate supervision, even under constraints on data and training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, these intermediate models still slightly underperformed relative to the best student models trained using standard distillation and fully pretrained weights. For instance, the best standard distillation model trained with a learning rate of 3e-5 reached an accuracy of 66.36%, outperforming all intermediate variants by a small but consistent margin."

    "The standard distilled student model, using a pretrained encoder and trained with soft targets only, showed a steady and substantial decrease in training loss over 4 epochs, as illustrated by the log-scaled loss curve.\n",

    "In Epoch 1, the model achieved a training loss of 0.6044 and a validation accuracy of 65.27%, which set the initial benchmark and was the best performance observed during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the training loss continued to decrease, 0.3775 in Epoch 2, 0.2525 in Epoch 3, and 0.2001 in Epoch 4, validation accuracy declined slightly in each subsequent epoch (63.82%, 63.14%, and 63.02%, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "As no new best accuracy was reached after Epoch 1, the early stopping counter incremented each time until it triggered after Epoch 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that while the model continued learning on the training set, its generalization to the validation set peaked early. The final model still retained strong performance, and the shape of the loss curve suggests that more training might not have improved generalization further without overfitting."

    "This intermediate-distilled student model (using a pretrained encoder and hidden-state alignment, TinyBERT-style) demonstrated strong initial performance but struggled to maintain generalization as training progressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Epoch 1, the model achieved a relatively high training loss of 0.8915, but also its best validation accuracy of 66.54%, which was not surpassed in later epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite substantial reductions in training loss in the following epochs, 0.6696, 0.4782, and 0.3427, validation accuracy steadily declined to 66.08%, 64.80%, and 64.71%, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because no further improvement occurred after Epoch 1, the early stopping mechanism triggered at Epoch 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training loss curve confirms a rapid and consistent drop in training loss, showing that the model continued fitting the training data. However, the decreasing validation accuracy suggests potential overfitting or a misalignment between the supervised and intermediate objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while this model leveraged both soft labels and intermediate hidden-state supervision, its performance plateaued early, highlighting that simply adding more objectives does not guarantee better generalization. Future attempts might benefit from adjusting the weighting of the intermediate loss or fine-tuning with fewer hidden layers."

    "\n",
    "Quantization is a technique used in model compression that reduces the precision of the numbers used to represent model parameters (e.g., weights) and sometimes also activations (as we have see as one of the techniques in class).\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models typically use 32-bit floating point (FP32) numbers. Quantization reduces this to 8-bit integers (INT8) or 16-bit floats, depending on the method (we use 8-bit integer quantization).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic quantization specifically only affects the weights of linear layers and does not require calibration data or retraining, so it is quite easy to apply. However, PPytorch does not allow for quantization of hugging face models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply dynamic quantization to the best standard student model obtained through knowledge distillation. We focus only on quantizing the linear layers, as they account for the majority of memory usage and floating-point operations (FLOPs) during inference. Reducing them to INT8 format can lead to substantial gains in inference speed and model size, especially on CPU-based deployment environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since model_pretrained is already trained and saved, we first used the torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic function to quantize the model’s linear layers. This converts their FP32 weights to INT8 representations. Initially, we quantized only the classifier, but later we converted the full model to ONNX format and applied dynamic quantization globally using ONNX Runtime. This is what you can see below:"

    "These are the final results of the best student models and the teacher, which was trained for five epochs on 5% of the dataset (and evaluated on 20% of that split, in effect, on 4% of the total data). The teacher model, a standard BERT trained with 1 masked token augmentation, achieved an accuracy of 66.28%, with a macro precision of 65.62% and a macro recall of 66.00%.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then trained two student models using knowledge distillation with alpha set to 0.2 and a temperature of 1.0. The first student was trained using standard distillation with a learning rate of 1e-4 for four epochs, leveraging only soft labels (the teacher’s predicted class distributions). The second was trained using intermediate distillation, with a lower learning rate of 3e-5, and included supervision not only from the teacher’s outputs but also from intermediate hidden states (inspired by TinyBERT-style techniques).\n",
    "\n",
    "Surprisingly, the intermediate student achieved the highest overall accuracy of 66.54%, even outperforming the teacher. This outcome may initially seem counterintuitive, as student models are typically expected to approximate but not surpass their teacher. However, there are a few compelling reasons why this occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it’s possible that the intermediate distillation process allowed the student to generalize better by aligning internal representations, not just final predictions. By matching hidden states across layers, the student may have absorbed richer structural patterns learned by the teacher, while also being regularized through pretrained initialization. Second, the student was initialized from pretrained weights, meaning it already had a strong foundation and may have benefited from better stability during fine-tuning with the lower learning rate. Third, the teacher might have slightly overfit to the training set, especially since it was trained over more epochs (five), whereas the student with intermediate supervision stopped earlier due to validation monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard student model achieved an accuracy of 65.27%, slightly below both the teacher and the intermediate student. Interestingly, after applying dynamic quantization, which compresses only the classifier layer to 8-bit integers, the model’s performance remained virtually unchanged. The quantized model reached almost identical accuracy, precision, and recall as its unquantized counterpart, demonstrating that this lightweight post-training optimization preserved the predictive capacity. This makes the quantized version especially attractive for deployment, as it maintains performance while reducing inference time and model size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, although the teacher was a strong model, the intermediate distillation strategy allowed the student to exceed its performance slightly, likely due to better internal guidance and more conservative optimization. Meanwhile, the quantized version of the standard student offered a strong trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, making it highly suitable for practical applications."

    "Evaluating all models on their inference speed (all ran on CPU), one can observe a clear advantage for the quantized ONNX model. While the teacher model took over 10 seconds to process 100 samples, and both student models required around 5 seconds, the quantized student model completed the same task in just 2.49 seconds. This confirms that dynamic quantization, combined with the ONNX runtime, can substantially reduce inference time, even without requiring any retraining. This makes it highly suitable for deployment on resource-constrained environments like edge devices or mobile CPUs, where speed and efficiency are critical."

Read Lee Stroebel's book 'The Case for a Creator'.  Read the Bible. The theory of evolution is full of holes.  It doesn't take a million years for one animal to turn into another... look at a catepillar turning into a butterfly, or a tadpole into a frog.  Look at the detail & fine balance of nature -- it's AWESOME!!! Somebody MADE it that way!!!  We just happen to be the exact distance from the sun so we don't burn, or freeze.

      "Text:      As far as I know, infertility is a major theme in Macbeth by William Shakespeare. His deceitful and treacherous acts resut in a disaster and his \"kingship\" is \"fruitless\" and \"infertile\". This theme is emphasized when we learn that Macbeth has no child, and that Banquo's descendants are prophesied to be the kings after Macbeth. Macbeth also describes his crown to be \"fruitless\". Thus, I believe that Macbeth has no child: his marriage with Lady Macbeth is \"fruitless\", they are infertile. However, a couple of lines in the text are against these analyses, they somehow interfere with the other lines. Here are the lines (the speaker is Lady Macbeth): \"...I have given suck, and know how tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me.\" (Act 1,Scene 7). So, here comes the question: Has Lady Macbeth ever had a child? If she did, then does the theme of infertility lose its importance? Or a third possibility: Did the children die soon after birth, before they can be considered heir to the throne?\n",

A friend I met recently had a totally different childhood, and spent her years wanting to be and acting older. She wore makeup at 9, heels at 10, got a boyfriend at 11, first went clubbing at 13 and lost her virginity at 15.  I wore makeup at 13, heels at 15, got a boyfriend at 16 and don't go clubbing much even now. \\n\\nWe got to talking about our childhoods, and my friend says she really regrets trying to grow up too fast. She feels that she has lost her childhood. However, she is much more street-smart than me and has got me out of a number of sticky situations. Myself, I find that my childhood did not prepare me for the adult world. I don't often feel safe doing these more \"grown-up\" things and I often wish I was a child again just so that I wouldn't have to cope with it.\\nWhich of us do you think got the better deal?\n",

They say that they are trying. What they try?\\n\\nOne of the answers is that they try flavours like flavours of ice cream.\\nAnother answer is that they try that if they physically fit with another. Does it actually matter cause as the age goes by sex dies and things get loose; at least of fair sex. \\n\\nAdded to that they say that the longer the life the more certainty is that they would change their partners? What is the relationship between longer life and changing partners.\\n\\nBy the by my formula for life equals expected years one would live multiplied by an achievement factor.

Well, I’ve always had a hard time answering the questions involving loss of energy, loss of interest, ect,  bcause I have always had few/too many interests; have a difficult time making friends, or keeping them once I made them; turn down others invitations to events bcause I don’t have energy to do them- even as a kid I hated spending time after school doing things bcause I much rather be at home or didn’t want to be away from home so long.  \\n\\nOnce a therapist suggested I’d been depressed since childhood, but I quickly dismissed her. But recently I’ve been thinking she was right.

    "The error analysis shows that while the student model sometimes misclassifies questions that the teacher gets right, these errors often involve subtle or emotionally complex topics. For example, the student struggles with short or vague texts, like “zakcort1” or “I don't,” which the teacher handles correctly. It also tends to confuse categories that are similar, such as health and relationships or polls and chatting. Despite these cases, it’s worth noting that the student model actually achieved higher overall accuracy than the teacher, suggesting that it generalizes better in many situations. To fully understand the performance difference, we should also examine cases where the teacher fails but the student gets it right, as this would reveal complementary strengths and areas where the student has surpassed the teacher."

Consciousness is mechanistic and predictable.\\n\\nBut this seems to be a straw man analogy to get to the desired conclusion.  For example, if you get into your time machine and go back in time to observe yourself, you will find that you will do everything the same, since everything is exactly the same.  It is a self-evident tautology, and does not rule in or rule out free will.\\n\\nThe premise is that consciousness can be created by computational power.  Ray Kurzweil predicts this in his book, The Age of Spiritual Machines based on, “prophesy”.  Professor John Searle at UC Berkeley says this is absurd, for “computers just shuffle symbols”.\\n\\nDo you think you have free will?\\nHow can this be tested?\n",

His music isn't \"goth,\" but I do like it.\\n\\nWith that in mind, I am somewhat confused by something I keep seeing in the gothic scene: that is, people with a rabid dislike of Marilyn Manson. Not just, \"I don't like Marilyn Manson,\" or \"Marilyn Manson doesn't do goth music,\" but, \"Marilyn Manson is NOT goth and anyone who listens to him and claims to be goth is a POSEUR!\" So, I ask the goths out there, why is that? Do you hate Marilyn Manson? If so, why? Is it because people falsely believe his music is goth? Is it because people with negative stereotypes about goths often point to him? Just wondering.\n",

    "These examples illustrate that the intermediate student model can **outperform the teacher** in cases where the input is ambiguous, colloquial, or context-heavy. For instance, in Example 27, the text discusses sexuality in an informal, personal tone. While the **true label is 8 (likely “Family & Relationships”)**, the **teacher misclassifies it as 2**, possibly misinterpreting the tone or content. The student, in contrast, correctly identifies the underlying category, demonstrating better contextual understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in shorter or vague prompts like Example 34 (\"Think way back if you have to.\") where contextual guessing is crucial, the teacher fails while the student succeeds, showing that the student is more robust under minimal textual cues.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also knowledge-based queries such as Example 85 and Example 285, where the teacher selects overly general categories (label 0 or 9) while the student correctly assigns them to more appropriate topics like “Society & Culture” or “Education.” This suggests that the student model has likely learned finer-grained decision boundaries during training and generalizes better on nuanced cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the student correctly classifies emotionally charged or informal content (Example 619 and Example 465) which the teacher repeatedly mislabels. This points toward the student being better adapted to real-world, colloquial expressions, potentially due to the intermediate fine-tuning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these results highlight that while the teacher model is powerful, the student (especially when fine-tuned with intermediate supervision) can **outperform it in specific but important scenarios**, particularly those requiring subtle contextual understanding, handling of vague input, or sensitivity to informal language.\n"

    "The confusion matrices for the teacher and the intermediate-distilled student model reveal important differences in how each model performs across the ten topic categories. Overall, the intermediate student appears to generalize slightly better than the teacher, which aligns with its marginally higher accuracy score.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the clearest improvements can be seen in the \"Society & Culture\" category (label 0). The student correctly classifies 519 examples in this class, whereas the teacher only identifies 461 correctly. The teacher shows more dispersion across other categories, meaning it tends to misclassify these examples more often, particularly into \"Politics & Government\" and \"Education & Reference.\" The student's stronger performance here suggests that it learned to better capture the broad and somewhat ambiguous semantic patterns common to this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In \"Entertainment & Music\" (label 7), the student also shows an advantage. While the teacher makes more errors, misclassifying into related social categories, the student model predicts 558 instances correctly, slightly outperforming the teacher’s 528. The student similarly shows better precision in \"Business & Finance\" (label 6), classifying 295 examples correctly compared to the teacher's 283. In both cases, the student appears to have learned more robust intermediate representations that help it disambiguate between thematically similar classes.\n",

    "The category \"Politics & Government\" (label 9) remains challenging for both models. Although both models perform relatively well, the teacher has a slight edge with 600 correct predictions compared to the student’s 582. This may be due to the nuanced and often ambiguous language present in political questions, where richer contextual cues play a larger role, something the teacher’s deeper architecture might still represent more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some trade-offs. In \"Science & Mathematics\" (label 1), the teacher slightly outperforms the student. The teacher predicts 510 examples correctly, whereas the student drops to 504. This drop is not dramatic, but it suggests that the additional intermediate supervision may have redirected some model capacity toward improving performance on other, more ambiguous categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at \"Education & Reference\" (label 3), both models perform similarly. The teacher correctly classifies 365 examples, while the student achieves 357. The slight dip for the student might be due to its broader generalization behavior, possibly confusing this category with more fact-based or opinion-based ones like \"Society & Culture\" or \"Politics.\""

    "The bar plot shows a per-class accuracy comparison between the teacher model and the best student model (trained with intermediate layer distillation). While overall differences are modest, we can observe that the student model outperforms the teacher in several classes, most notably in class 0 (\"Society & Culture\") and class 7 (\"Entertainment & Music\"), where its relative gains suggest improved generalization for more ambiguous or socially themed content. On the other hand, the teacher performs slightly better in classes 2 (\"Health\"), 3 (\"Education & Reference\"), and 4 (\"Computers & Internet\"), where more domain-specific language might have favored the deeper architecture. For most other categories, including \"Politics & Government\" and \"Family & Relationships\", both models exhibit very similar accuracies, indicating that the student has successfully retained much of the teacher's performance despite being significantly more compact."

    "**Interpretations and Suggestions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we focused on student models based on the DistilBERT architecture, as a compact alternative to the full teacher model. Our motivation was to maintain strong classification performance while reducing inference time and model size. We found that even with relatively simple distillation setups, the student models achieved impressive results, especially the intermediate-distilled variant, which slightly outperformed the teacher in overall accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the faster inference and reduced memory footprint, training these models still requires considerable time and effort. Given that training is non-trivial, we were limited in the extent of hyperparameter tuning and experimentation that could be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main limitation of the student models lies in their reduced capacity. DistilBERT has fewer layers, smaller hidden dimensions, and fewer attention heads than BERT, which restricts its ability to model more complex, abstract relationships in the data. This makes the student more prone to underfitting, especially on difficult or ambiguous samples, as shown by its misclassifications in semantically rich or vague questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations, future work could explore using student architectures with intermediate depth, smaller than BERT but larger than DistilBERT, or even partially initializing students from teacher layers to combine compression with strong initialization. We also recommend trying structured pruning techniques to slim down the teacher while retaining key components, allowing for a more flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantization is another promising avenue. While our experiments with dynamic quantization (INT8) using ONNX maintained performance and reduced model size, it did not lead to clear inference speedups on GPU. More sophisticated approaches like quantization-aware training or mixed-precision optimization could further improve deployment viability without compromising accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, enhancing the distillation objective itself could yield gains. Our intermediate distillation setup, inspired by TinyBERT, already improved generalization by aligning internal representations. Future efforts might combine this with contrastive loss or attention-based alignment to further improve the student's ability to mimic the teacher's deeper semantic understanding without increasing model size."
